check_mem_ng.sh 1.0

Usage:
* check_mem_ng.sh [-w <warnlevel>] [-c <critlevel>] [-v]
 - checks local host available memory
 - warnlevel and critlevel is percentage value without %
 - defaults being respectively 80 et 90
 - add -v for verbose (debuging purpose)
* check_mem_ng.sh -V
 - prints version
* check_mem_ng.sh -h
 - prints help (this message)

Similarities/differences between check_mem.sh:
- Both don't need much to run: only bash, free and awk
- Compatible with "free" binary from either procps AND procps-ng (newer) whereas check_mem.sh is not
- Same basic syntax, you can exchange both scripts without changing your Nagios(r) configuration much
- Perfdata are a bit different now (more useful to me) but I might change it soon to ease migrations
- Added defaults to warn and critical, and help/version/verbose flags

Output:
./check_mem_ng.sh
OK: Memory below thresholds. Total: 7984 MB - Used: 288 MB - 3% used. | Memory_Used=302661632;6698119987;7535384985;0;8372649984
./check_mem_ng.sh -w 70 -c 85
OK: Memory below thresholds. Total: 7984 MB - Used: 288 MB - 3% used. | Memory_Used=302796800;5860854988;7116752486;0;8372649984

Next version:
I will soon add a "legacy perfdata mode" (or maybe a "new perfdata mode") to ease the switch from existing  check_mem.sh installations. 
I don't use BUFFER/CACHE graphs but I figure that some people might want to keep their perfdata as they are.
